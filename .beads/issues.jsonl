Consider hybrid approach: common columns + JSONB for type-specific variant fields.\n- Beta: Use PostgREST + supabase-py async client. pgvector supports 3072-dim embeddings. Phased migration (0-5 phases, 14-21h total, MVP in 5-7h).\n- Gamma: Foreign keys + cascade rules essential for edge-\u003enode references. Disable RLS for hackathon speed. LLM response cache should stay in-memory, not DB.\n\nCONSENSUS:\n1. Hybrid schema: nodes table with common fields + JSONB extras, edges table with type column\n2. pgvector for embeddings (replaces numpy cosine similarity)\n3. Supabase Realtime for frontend push (optional, stretch goal)\n4. Disable RLS for now — add auth later\n5. Gateway pattern (graph_store.py + graph_manager.py) means only 2 files need core changes\n6. LLM cache stays in-memory\n7. Phased approach: schema+seed first, then read path, then write path, then vectors\n\nNEXT: Invoke User Elicitation for user preferences on configuration and approach.","created_at":"2026-02-08T02:33:28Z"}]}
